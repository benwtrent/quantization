# quantization
vector quantization methodology exploration in Python.

TODO
 - [ ] more data sets & similarity methods (euclidean & max-inner-product)
 - [ ] verify that similarity can be transformed to be similar ranges for all similarity methods between quantized and non-quantized vectors
 - [ ] test PQ
 - [ ] Test quantization schemes on subsets of vectors, merging, and determining adequate thresholds for vector re-quantization on data set merges
